# **useReducer Hook Example**  

This project demonstrates the usage of the `useReducer` hook in React, focusing on **state management** when dealing with multiple updates and complex logic.  

## üìå **Features**  
- **Centralized State Management**: Handles state updates through a reducer function.  
- **Improved Performance**: Suitable for managing **complex state transitions**.  
- **Scalable Approach**: Better than `useState` when handling multiple related state changes.  

## üîπ **Key Learnings**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Counter with `useReducer`**  

The `useReducer` hook is useful when **state transitions depend on actions**. Instead of directly updating the state using `useState`, we dispatch actions to a reducer.  

#### **How It Works:**  
- The **`dispatch` function** sends an action object `{ type: ACTION }` to the `reducer`.  
- The `reducer` **modifies the state** based on the action type.  
- This makes state updates more structured and **avoids direct state mutation**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Todo List with `useReducer`**  

In a **real-world application**, state updates often involve **multiple properties** (e.g., adding, deleting, and toggling todos). Using `useReducer` keeps logic clean.  

#### **How It Works:**  
- The `dispatch` function **triggers actions** (`ADD_TODO`, `TOGGLE_TODO`, `DELETE_TODO`).  
- The `reducer` processes these actions and returns an updated todo list.  
- The **state updates remain centralized**, making debugging easier.

## üîÑ **Flowchart for Counter App with `useReducer`**  

This flowchart explains how **user actions trigger state updates** in the counter app.  

```mermaid
graph TD;
  User["User Clicks Button"] -->|"+ Button"| DispatchIncrement["Dispatch(INCREMENT)"];
  User -->|"- Button"| DispatchDecrement["Dispatch(DECREMENT)"];
  
  DispatchIncrement --> ReducerIncrement["Reducer Updates State: count +1"];
  DispatchDecrement --> ReducerDecrement["Reducer Updates State: count -1"];
  
  ReducerIncrement --> UpdateUI["UI Re-renders with New State"];
  ReducerDecrement --> UpdateUI;
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The **user clicks a button** (`+` or `-`).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ An **action is dispatched** (`INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT`).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The **reducer function updates the state** accordingly.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The **React UI re-renders** to reflect the new count.
